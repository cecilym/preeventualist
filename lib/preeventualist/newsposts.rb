    text: "i know there's a lot of noise today.  stanley bros circus lost twelve llamas and a
trailer and a bunch of Masterlocks and five tents.  they're still finding lost stuff.
pls keep your heads, i need everyone's help.  these entertainers have _nothing_.  i 
mean it.  i gave a guy a purple sticker today (it's just something i like to do as a
kind gesture) and he practically slept on it and farmed the ingredients for pizza sauce
on it.  they are on rock bottom.

so please donate.  i know we don't have paypal or anything.  so if you want to donate,
just post that you found something (a children's bike, a month of perishable canned 
goods) and that it has the circus people's names written on it or something.",

    text: "we're all sifting through the carpet here at hq, but if you could all keep an eye out 
for caitlin's clipboard, she's too quiet of a gal to post it and i know that it's 
REALLY important to her.  she had a few really expensive panoramic radiographs of her 
husband's underbite clipped to a few irreplacable photos of her husband in a robocop 
costume back when the underbite was more prominent.  she says (to me), \"they'll know
what i mean when they see them.\"  i don't know what that means.  :(

i've checked: * the front desk * the hall * the waiting area * the bathroom * the candy 
closet * the big tv area * the lunch counter * the disciples room * gaff's old room
(the one with the painting of the cherry tree) * the server room * staircase.  i'll 
update this as i find more rooms.",
